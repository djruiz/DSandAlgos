I used my starter code from hw03 to set up my model view and controller.  I then used a pre
written bubble sort function and set changes and notified observers whenever a swap occurs during 
the sort

To graphically represent these swaps I drew two rectangles at the same x coordinate.  I offset them
so that the new value being inserted into x is drawn as white and the remaining space covered in black

This gave my sort a smooth appearance.
